INTRODUCTION
============

This repo is meant to build a docker image based on Alpine Linux that can be used for network configurations via environment variables

Environment variables supported
-------------------------------

For ipv4
--------

To set an ipv4 address on an interface, the following environment variables must be present:

NET_IFNAME
NET_IPV4_ADDRESS
NET_IPV4_NETMASK

Optionally routes can be added if the following were present:

NET_IPV4_DEST_PREFIX
NET_IPV4_GATEWAY

If NET_SEND_GRATUITOUS_ARP is set to a number, an unsolicated gratuitious arp packets will be sent over the interface once it get configured (number of packets to be sent is from the env. variable)

For ipv6
--------

To set an ipv6 address on an interface, the following environment variables must be present:

NET_IFNAME
NET_IPV6_ADDRESS
NET_IPV6_NETMASK

Optionally routes can be added if the following were present:

NET_IPV6_DEST_PREFIX
NET_IPV6_GATEWAY
